To build and run the demos in this module, follow these steps:

Create the Database:
- Make sure you have SQL Server Developer Edition or Express on your machine.
- Double click the ZzaDatabaseGen.sql file to open it in SQL Management studio
- Connect to the appropriate DB server as SQL Management Studio opens where you want the DB to live.
- Create a New Database named Zza with default settings
- Execute the ZzaDatabaseGen.sql file to populate the Zza DB

NOTE: If you used a DB server other than the default instance for your local machine (i.e. \SQLExpress) then you
will need to edit the app.config for all the demos and change the server part of the connection string for the 
ZzaDbContext to point to your server instead (edit the server=. portion of the connection string and replace . with whatever your server name is).

Open the solution and restore NuGet packages:
- Make sure you have NuGet package restore enabled under Tools > Options > NuGet Package Manager > General (both check boxes)
- Right click on the solution root in Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...
- The top of the dialog will have a yellow bar with a Restore button if packages are missing, click it to restore (requires internet connection)

You should then be able to build and run the demos.
