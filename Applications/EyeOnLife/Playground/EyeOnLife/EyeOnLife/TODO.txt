- Add Async/Await to fix Debug message delay.

	without having to show all levels.  E.g. on non top level screen
- Add commands from Admin_X to AdminX_Main controls.  Pull out into common routines.
- Explore TableAdapterManager and use or create GetXTableAdapter methods.  Clean up all the places that need tableadapters.
